**3 modes are available:**
* Tile _-> Move all the furniture on a single tile when you type ```:move```_
* Auto _-> The same as "tile", but stays enabled until you type ```:abort```_
* Rectangle _-> Move all furniture in a region_
   * You may select _Inverse direction_, to mirror the selection

By default, "Use stacktile (2x2)" is enabled to copy the exact heights of every furniture. You may also unselect it
There are **3 options:**
* Match height
* Offset _-> move the selection with an offset_
* Flatten _-> Place all the furniture at the same height, useful for hiding wired_

**Commands:**
* :move
* :abort _-> aborts remaining movements_
* :undo _-> you may undo any past movements_
* :exclude _-> exclude a type of furniture from being moved (for example, the floor). You will be asked to shift+click a furniture of the type_
* :include _-> undo the :exclude_
* :reset _-> clear the list of excluded furni types_

**Other options:**
* The checkbox **Visual help** gives you information inside your client
* **Wired safety** makes sure to move wired in an order so a stack is never left without it's conditions
